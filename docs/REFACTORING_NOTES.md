# ActivityMonitor Refactoring Notes

## Overview
The `ActivityMonitor.swift` file has been successfully refactored from a single 653-line file into smaller, more manageable components following the Single Responsibility Principle.

## Refactoring Changes

### 1. Created Models Folder
A new `Models` folder was created to house all data model structures:

- **`Models/AppActivationEvent.swift`** - Contains the `AppActivationEvent` struct with custom `NSImage` Codable implementation
- **`Models/ContextSwitchMetrics.swift`** - Contains the `ContextSwitchMetrics` struct and `SwitchType` enum
- **`Models/AppUsageStat.swift`** - Contains `AppUsageStat` and `SiteUsageStat` structs

### 2. Created Extension Files
Logic has been extracted into focused extension files:

- **`ActivityAnalytics.swift`** - Extension containing all analytics methods:
  - `switchesInLast5Minutes`
  - `todaysSwitchCount`
  - `estimatedTimeLostInMinutesToday`
  - `getContextSwitches`
  - `getSwitchStatistics`
  - `getMostCommonSwitches`
  - `getAverageTimeBeforeSwitch`
  - `getSwitchesByHour`
  - `appUsageStats`
  - `siteUsageStats`

- **`ChromeIntegration.swift`** - Extension for Chrome-specific functionality:
  - `handleChromeActivation(for:)` - Handles Chrome tab tracking and favicon fetching

- **`SessionManager.swift`** - Extension for session management:
  - `manageSession(at:)` - Manages session tracking logic
  - `startNewSession(at:)` - Creates new sessions
  - `updateLastEventTime(_:)` - Updates tracking timestamps

### 3. Updated ActivityMonitor.swift
The main file now focuses solely on:
- App activation observation
- Data persistence coordination
- Publishing state changes
- Core initialization and setup

### 4. Access Level Changes
Session tracking properties were changed from `private` to `internal` to allow access from extensions:
- `lastEventTime`
- `currentSessionId`
- `currentSessionStartTime`
- `currentSessionSwitchCount`

## Benefits of Refactoring

1. **Improved Code Organization** - Each file has a single, clear responsibility
2. **Better Maintainability** - Smaller files are easier to understand and modify
3. **Enhanced Testability** - Individual components can be tested in isolation
4. **Reduced Complexity** - The main ActivityMonitor class is now much simpler
5. **Easier Navigation** - Developers can quickly find specific functionality

## File Size Comparison

- **Before**: `ActivityMonitor.swift` - 653 lines
- **After**:
  - `ActivityMonitor.swift` - ~201 lines
  - `ActivityAnalytics.swift` - ~150 lines
  - `ChromeIntegration.swift` - ~62 lines
  - `SessionManager.swift` - ~50 lines
  - Model files - ~50-100 lines each

## Next Steps

1. **Testing** - Thoroughly test all functionality in Xcode to ensure nothing was broken
2. **Unit Tests** - Consider adding unit tests for the newly separated components
3. **Documentation** - Update inline documentation for the new structure
4. **Further Refactoring** - Consider extracting data persistence logic into a separate extension

## Notes

- All original functionality has been preserved
- No external API changes were made
- The refactoring maintains backward compatibility
- Swift's module system automatically makes all files in the same target accessible without special imports

## Compilation Fixes Required

After the initial refactoring, several compilation errors needed to be addressed:

1. **Missing Computed Properties** - Added to `ActivityAnalytics.swift`:
   - `totalSwitches` - Total activation count (all time)
   - `totalSwitchesToday` - Today's activation count
   - `estimatedTimeLostInMinutes` - Time lost calculation (all time)
   - `estimatedCostLost` - Financial cost (all time)
   - `estimatedCostLostToday` - Today's financial cost

2. **Access Level Changes**:
   - Changed `lastAppSwitch` from `private` to `internal` to allow access from other views
   - Added public method `addContextSwitch` for testing/preview purposes

3. **Model Updates**:
   - Added `description` computed property to `SwitchType` enum
   - Created convenience initializer for `ContextSwitchMetrics` for backwards compatibility
   - Fixed `AppUsageStat` initialization to include required `lastActiveTimestamp` parameter

4. **View Refactoring**:
   - Extracted complex views in `UsageStackView` into separate `ChromeUsageRow` and `StandardAppRow` components to resolve type-checking timeout

All compilation errors have been resolved and the project now builds successfully.
